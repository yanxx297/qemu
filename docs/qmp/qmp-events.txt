                   QEMU Machine Protocol Events
                   ============================

QUORUM_FAILURE
--------------

Emitted by the Quorum block driver if it fails to establish a quorum.

Data:

- "reference":    device name if defined else node name.
- "sector-num":   Number of the first sector of the failed read operation.
- "sector-count": Failed read operation sector count.

Example:

{ "event": "QUORUM_FAILURE",
     "data": { "reference": "usr1", "sector-num": 345435, "sector-count": 5 },
     "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344522075, "microseconds": 745528 } }

QUORUM_REPORT_BAD
-----------------

Emitted to report a corruption of a Quorum file.

Data:

- "error":        Error message (json-string, optional)
                  Only present on failure.  This field contains a human-readable
                  error message.  There are no semantics other than that the
                  block layer reported an error and clients should not try to
                  interpret the error string.
- "node-name":    The graph node name of the block driver state.
- "sector-num":   Number of the first sector of the failed read operation.
- "sector-count": Failed read operation sector count.

Example:

{ "event": "QUORUM_REPORT_BAD",
     "data": { "node-name": "1.raw", "sector-num": 345435, "sector-count": 5 },
     "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344522075, "microseconds": 745528 } }
