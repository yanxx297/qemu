Red Hat, Inc. donates a part of its device ID range to qemu, to be used for
virtual devices.  The vendor IDs are 1af4 (formerly Qumranet ID) and 1b36.

Contact Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel@redhat.com> to get a device ID assigned
for your devices.

The 1000 -> 10ff device ID range is used as follows for virtio-pci devices.

maintained as part of the virtio specification.

1af4:1005  entropy generator device

1af4:10f0  Available for experimental usage without registration.  Must get
   to      official ID when the code leaves the test lab (i.e. when seeking
1af4:10ff  upstream merge or shipping a distro/product) to avoid conflicts.

1af4:1100  Used as PCI Subsystem ID for existing hardware devices emulated
           by qemu.

All other device IDs are reserved.
