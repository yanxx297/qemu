# Union branch 'type'
# FIXME: this triggers an assertion failure. But even with that fixed,
# we would have a clash in generated C, between the simple union's
# implicit tag member 'kind' and the branch name 'kind' within the
# union. We should either reject this, or munge the generated C to let
# it compile.
# TODO: Even when the generated C is switched to use 'type' rather than
# 'kind', to match the QMP spelling, the collision should still be detected.
